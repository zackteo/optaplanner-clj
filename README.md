# optaplanner-clj

[Optaplanner example](https://quarkus.io/version/1.7/guides/optaplanner#the-value-range-providers) in Clojure (+ Java). 

Please view joinr's fork to see a complete Clojure version that we worked on https://github.com/joinr/optaplanner-clj.

There were too many type annotations to use `deftype` in Clojure

## Usage

Hope this can help someone.

`lein javac` to compile the Java classes and execute `(solve (generateProblem))` in core.clj in the repl
